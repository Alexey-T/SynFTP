- Connect to ftp which doesnt reply. Need to wait 30(def) sec, CANNOT do any while this. todo: allow Abort press for it.

Minor:
- printf, vprintf etc not really nicely used (no size checking/expanding buffers)
- StringUtils: inefficient when using tchar+CP_ACP
- MS VS gives a heap corruption during ssh_userauth_none, gcc is silent. Unable to debug
